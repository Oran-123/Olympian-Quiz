# UX

## User Goals 

* A visually appealing landing page which clearly communicates the purpose of the site 
* Buttons that help the user navigate through ought the site 
* A modal with instructions on how to play the quiz 
* A leader board to display the results of previous players 
* Engaging and challenging questions 
* Easy and intuitive navigation on all screen sizes
* Form to join the membership to receive updates on prizes, competitions and updates to the quiz

## User Stories 

* As a user, I want to be able to create a username 
* As a user, I want to be able to choose between three quizzes which vary in their level of difficulty  
* As a user, I want to see a progress bar during the quiz, so I know how many questions remain 
* As a user, I want to see my total score at the end of the quiz 
* As a user, I want to see other playerâ€™s results on the leader board 
* As a user, I want to join the newsletter so that I can keep up to date with competitions, prizes and new quizzes

## Site Owner Goals 

* Create a site that is intuitive to navigate for visitors 
* Provide users with feedback after they finish a quiz 
* Provide a leader board with results of all users who played the quiz 
* Create a positive user experience through a visually appealing site 
* Capture user emails for email marketing purposes 

# Requirements and Expectations 

## Requirments 

* Mobile first design, which is responsive on all larger screens 
* The design uses a colour scheme which is easy to view 
* From the home page the user can access instructions, the quiz and the leader board 
* After each question is answered the user is provided with feedback in the form of a visual que which highlights if they answered the question correctly 
* The user is provided with a result at the end of their quiz 
* Social media accounts can be accessed via the footer of the site 

## Expectations 

* I expect to set my own unique username 
* I expect that there will be quizzes with different levels of difficulty 
* I expect to be able to see a result on my performance 
* I expect to see my result listed on the leader board after I complete a game 
* I expect that the site scales correctly on different size screens 

# Design Choices 

## Inspiration  
 
1. [Official Olympic Website](https://olympics.com/en/ "Official Olympic Website") 

    * The color scheme of the site will follow a similar style to the Olympic website 
    * The logo of the site will be used as the favicon for this site 
    * The logo of this site will be used as inspiration for this site 


## Fonts
I have used google fonts to select a font type that best supports the goals of the website. For the main text I have selected Judson because the rounded edges portray an approachable brand. To make the headers and the navigation bar stand out from the text, I decided to use Quando.

## Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap breakpoints").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |
