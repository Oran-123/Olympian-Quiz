# Design Choices 

## Inspiration  
 
1. [Official Olympic Website](https://olympics.com/en/ "Official Olympic Website") 

    * The logo of the site will be used as the favicon for this site 
    * The logo of this site will be used as inspiration for this site 


## Fonts

I have used google fonts to select a font type that best supports the goals of the website. For the main text I have selected [Judson](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Judson?preview.text=test&preview.text_type=custom&query=Judson#styles "Judson") because the rounded edges portray an approachable brand. To make the headers and the navigation bar stand out from the text, I decided to use [Quando](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quando?preview.text=test&preview.text_type=custom&query=quando "Quando").

## Images

It is important that the large background image used in the hero section portrays an athlete to highlight the purpose of the site which is a sport quiz 

Again, images associated with the Olympic will be used in the background of the section which includes the form on the landing page and of the page which includes the leader board 

## Icons

The font awesome library will be used throughout the site for social media links and to provide visual aids for the results of questions and to provide overall feedback on the userâ€™s quiz. All icons will be consistent with the style of the Olympic brand. 


## Colours 

The inspiration for the colours was taken from the Olympic logo. I used the website [colourmind](http://colormind.io/ "colourmind") to pick the specific shades for this colour scheme. I tested the colours I selected on the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/ "WebAIM") contract checker which showed that they have no contrast issues. 

## Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap breakpoints").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes 

I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version of the wireframes and then designed what the site would look like on larger devices. I did not create a design for each size listed in the structure section, the mobile wireframes cover x-small and small, the tablet covers medium and the desktop covers large and x-large. 

The wireframes are below:

### [Mobile Wireframes](docs-readme/Mobiles%20Wireframes.pdf "Mobile Wireframes")
### [Tablet Wireframes](docs-readme/Tablet%20Concept.pdf "Tablet Wireframes")
### [Desktop Wireframes](docs-readme/Desktop%20Concept.pdf "Desktop Wireframes")
